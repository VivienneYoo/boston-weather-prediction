BOSTON WEATHER PREDICTION MODEL - PROJECT SUMMARY
======================================================================

Project Info:
------------
Dataset: 10 years of Boston weather (2013-2023)
Records processed: 3,988 days
Features engineered: 18 (includes lag variables, rolling averages, cyclical encoding)
Target: Daily average temperature

Model Performance:
-----------------
Algorithm: Linear Regression
Training accuracy: 99.66%
Testing accuracy: 99.50%
RMSE: 1.17°F
MAE: 0.86°F

The model exceeded the 85% accuracy target by a significant margin.

Seasonal Breakdown:
------------------
Fall:    99.29% (±0.73°F) - most predictable
Spring:  98.81% (±0.87°F)
Summer:  98.11% (±0.70°F)
Winter:  97.62% (±1.11°F) - most variable

Key Findings:
------------
1. Boston's coastal climate shows highest predictability during Fall,
   with prediction errors typically under 1 degree

2. Winter weather is hardest to predict, probably due to storm systems
   and temperature swings

3. Most important features for prediction:
   - Daily high/low temps
   - Seasonal patterns (cyclical encoding)
   - Precipitation and wind

4. Model captures both seasonal trends and day-to-day changes well

Technical Details:
-----------------
- Lag features: 1, 3, and 7-day historical temps
- Time series split: No shuffling to preserve temporal order
- Cyclical encoding: Sin/cos transformations for months and days
- Rolling windows: 7-day and 30-day moving averages
